"""Phase 3 — regex/alias router (no LLM, for explainability + determinism; see DECISIONS.md).

Decides how a question is handled:
  - >=1 of our six companies named   -> "single" (1) or "decompose" (2+), filtered retrieval
  - 0 named + superlative wording     -> "decompose" over all six
  - 0 named + a specific OTHER entity -> "oos" (out-of-corpus): retrieve unfiltered, let the
                                          dense-similarity threshold gate decide (e.g. "Tesla's revenue")
  - 0 named + nothing specific        -> "clarify": ask for the company, do not guess
