"""Phase 3 — synthesis: stream a grounded answer from retrieved chunks, temp 0.

This is the SECOND refusal gate (the in-corpus-but-undisclosed case): the prompt forbids using
anything outside the provided context, so when a company's chunks were retrieved but lack the
asked figure, the model says "not found for <company>" instead of guessing. Citations are inline
[chunk_id]; gaps are derived afterward (a target company with no cited chunk).

    "- Cite every figure inline with its chunk id in square brackets, e.g. [NVDA-0062] or [NVDA-MKT-...].\n"

    "- If the question is about a company other than the six listed above, say: "
    "'<Company> is not among the six companies I cover (Apple, JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, "
    "Coca-Cola, NVIDIA, Caterpillar). I cannot answer questions about it.' "

    "- If the context does not contain the asked figure for a company, say plainly "

    "(fiscal years differ: Apple ends in September, NVIDIA and Walmart in January, others in December).\n"

    "geographic breakdown (e.g. one reportable segment's revenue), label it as segment-level and "
    "do not present it as the company-wide total.\n"
