# DECISIONS.md — running log

Updated as choices are made (guardrail G7), not batched at the end.

## Architecture (locked, from PLAN_2.md)
- Stack: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, single static HTML/JS page (no React, no build step).
- Vector store: Chroma (local, persisted). BM25: `rank_bm25`.
- Embeddings: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (Anthropic has no embeddings API).
- Chat LLM: Anthropic (Claude) for decomposition + synthesis, temperature 0.
- Pipeline, not agent: question -> router -> [decompose] -> hybrid retrieval -> threshold gate -> synthesis.
- Routing: regex/alias map (no LLM) for explainability + determinism.
- Refusal: two distinct gates (out-of-corpus threshold on normalized dense similarity; in-corpus-undisclosed via synthesis/gaps).

### Phase 3 — chat model choice (2026-06-10)
- Chat model = `claude-sonnet-4-6` (NOT Opus 4.8). Reason: the spec mandates temperature 0
  everywhere for determinism (G5). Opus 4.8/4.7 REMOVED the `temperature` parameter — passing
  it returns HTTP 400 — so temp-0 determinism is impossible on Opus. Sonnet 4.6 still accepts
  `temperature=0`, is well-suited to this extractive decomposition+synthesis task, and is
  cheaper ($3/$15 per 1M vs $5/$25). Decomposition uses structured JSON output
  (`output_config.format`, json_schema); synthesis streams via `messages.stream()`.

## Dependencies (G2 — one line each)
See requirements.txt; each line carries its justification.

## Decision log
- 2026-06-10: Fetch ALL SIX filings from EDGAR through one clean path (incl. Apple), rather
  than using a viewer-saved Apple file. Reason: provided file was unavailable; uniform path
  is simpler and the CSS-residue stripping in parse.py is built defensively regardless.
- 2026-06-10: Chat LLM = Anthropic (Claude); embeddings = OpenAI. Two keys: Claude has no
  embeddings API, so dense retrieval needs OpenAI text-embedding-3-small.
- 2026-06-10: EDGAR User-Agent = "Abhishek <walvekarabhishek701@gmail.com>" per SEC fair-access policy.
- 2026-06-10: BLOCKER (Phase 3): chromadb pulls native chroma-hnswlib, which has no prebuilt
  wheel for Python 3.13 on Windows -> source build fails (needs MSVC C++ build tools). Phase 2
  needs no vector store, so deferred. RESOLVED: chromadb 1.5.9 ships prebuilt cp313 Windows
  wheels (no C++ build needed); repinned 0.5.23 -> 1.5.9. Verified `import chromadb` works.
- 2026-06-10: EDGAR-fetched files are CLEAN (0 <style>/<script>, minimal css- noise) — unlike
  the viewer-saved Apple copy the plan referenced. CSS-residue stripping kept defensively.
  Files ARE Inline XBRL: ix:nonFraction tags present (NVDA ~1127) carrying value/scale/unit/
  period — available for the optional headline-figure cross-check.

### Phase 2 — parse/chunk/validate (2026-06-10)
- Walk the doc as ordered leaf-<div> + <table> blocks (SEC wraps each line in its own div).
- Item headings: regex `^Item N.` at position 0, NOT inside <a> (kills TOC links + "refer to
  Item 1A" cross-refs), short block. Detected on any div (not just leaf — WMT nests its
  headings) and deduped by item number so an outer wrapper + inner copy don't double-emit.
- Tables: expand colspan/rowspan into a dense grid; BLANK `$`/`%` marker cells in place (then
  drop all-empty columns) so every row keeps the same width and values stay aligned to headers
  — removing `$` per-row was the bug that drifted numbers off their year. Header zone = leading
  rows with no *magnitude* cell; years/dates are periods (kept as headers), not values. Each
  data row serialized self-contained: "section | label | <col header> = <value>". Accounting
  negatives (1,234) -> -1234. Layout tables (no magnitude cells) skipped. Units read from the
  table text + the caption line just above (SEC puts "(In millions)" there).
- Footnotes immediately following a table are appended to that table's block as "[footnote] ...".
- Chunking: prose ~800 tokens / 100 overlap (tiktoken cl100k_base), flushed at Item boundaries
  so chunks never straddle Items. Tables kept whole; tables >1000 tokens split by rows with the
  header line repeated on each piece. chunk_id = "{TICKER}-{NNNN}". 2419 chunks total.
- validate.py is a REPORT (warns, never blocks): (a) Items 1/1A/7/8 present, (b) revenue term in
  a numeric table, (c) CSS/JS residue, (d) irregular-row-width tables (precision heuristic:
  flag when the modal row width covers <60% of rows = likely multi-level drift), (e) prints the
  largest table per company + 2 seeded-random table chunks. Spot-checked headline figures by
  hand: AAPL total net sales 416,161; WMT total revenues 713,163; NVDA revenue 215,938 — all
  correct and bound to the right fiscal year.

### Phase 3 — retrieval, gates, threshold calibration (2026-06-10)
- Hybrid retrieval = BM25 (rank_bm25, over all chunks) + dense (OpenAI embeddings in Chroma,
  cosine) fused with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF_K=60). Company metadata filter on the dense
  side via Chroma `where`, on the sparse side by post-filtering. top-k 6 single / 4 per sub-query.
- Refusal gate 1 (out-of-corpus) sits on the NORMALIZED dense cosine similarity of the top chunk,
  NOT the RRF score (RRF is rank-based, no absolute meaning).
- Threshold provisionally calibrated to 0.50 from the four Phase-3 checkpoint probes:
    NVIDIA revenue 0.697 | R&D sub-queries 0.61-0.71 | Coca-Cola attrition 0.518 (in-corpus,
    undisclosed) | Tesla revenue 0.487 (out-of-corpus).
  0.50 sits between Tesla (out) and KO-attrition (in), so Tesla refuses via the THRESHOLD gate
  and KO-attrition passes the threshold then refuses via the SYNTHESIS/gaps gate — the two-gate
  design. Margin is thin (~0.015 each side) — Known Weakness #5; Phase 6 refines with the user's
  eval probes (per-query-type thresholds are the next-week fix).
- anthropic SDK upgraded 0.42.0 -> 0.109.1: 0.42 predates `output_config` (structured JSON output
  used for decomposition). Verified the four checkpoint questions behave per spec after upgrade.

### Phase 3/2 fix — table caption in chunk text (2026-06-10, found via manual test)
- Bug: "net sales by region for Apple" returned a false "not found" — the segment-table chunk
  was parsed correctly but unretrievable: its searchable text carried only the generic Item
  heading (no "segment"/"region"), so BM25+dense ranked product-table/MD&A prose above it and
  it fell outside top-k. System did NOT hallucinate (refused on bad context) — a retrieval miss.
- Fix: parse.py now prepends each table's caption (the prose line just above it, e.g. "The
  following table shows net sales by reportable segment...") to the table chunk's header, making
  tables retrievable by description. Re-ingested (2419 -> 2427 chunks). Verified the exact query
  now returns Americas 178,353 / Europe 111,032 / Greater China 64,377 / Japan 28,703 / Rest of
  Asia Pacific 33,696 / Total 416,161, matching the filing. Four checkpoint questions: no regression.
- Side effect: re-embedding shifted KO-attrition probe 0.518 -> 0.503 (still > 0.50). Threshold
  margin is now razor-thin — reinforces Known Weakness #5; Phase 6 calibration with more probes.

### Phase 4 — frontend (2026-06-10)
- Single static page (static/index.html), vanilla JS, no build step. FastAPI serves it at `/`
  and streams answers from `GET /api/stream?q=` via SSE (EventSource). Two event types: `token`
  (incremental answer text) and `done` (citations + gaps). Citations render as expandable
  <details> passages labeled company + section. Refusals stream as a single token + done.
- Verified at the protocol level: page serves, NVIDIA streams + cites NVDA-0179 (contains
  "Total revenue = 215,938"), Tesla refuses via threshold.

All exact form "10-K" (no 10-K/A amendments). Note the differing fiscal year ends (Apple
Sep, NVDA/WMT Jan, others Dec) — this matters for cross-company comparisons (Phase 6 eval).
