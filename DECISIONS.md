# DECISIONS.md — running log

Updated as choices are made (guardrail G7), not batched at the end.

## Architecture (locked, from PLAN_2.md)

- Stack: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, single static HTML/JS page (no React, no build step).
- Vector store: Chroma (local, persisted). BM25: `rank_bm25`.
- Embeddings: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (Anthropic has no embeddings API).
- Chat LLM: Anthropic (Claude) for decomposition + synthesis, temperature 0.
- Pipeline, not agent: question -> router -> [decompose] -> hybrid retrieval -> threshold gate -> synthesis.
- Routing: regex/alias map (no LLM) for explainability + determinism.
- Refusal: two distinct gates (out-of-corpus threshold on normalized dense similarity; in-corpus-undisclosed via synthesis/gaps).

### Phase 3 — chat model choice (2026-06-10)

- Chat model = `claude-sonnet-4-6` (NOT Opus 4.8). Reason: the spec mandates temperature 0
everywhere for determinism (G5). Opus 4.8/4.7 REMOVED the `temperature` parameter — passing
it returns HTTP 400 — so temp-0 determinism is impossible on Opus. Sonnet 4.6 still accepts
`temperature=0`, is well-suited to this extractive decomposition+synthesis task, and is
cheaper ($3/$15 per 1M vs $5/$25). Decomposition uses structured JSON output
(`output_config.format`, json_schema); synthesis streams via `messages.stream()`.

## Dependencies (G2 — one line each)

See requirements.txt; each line carries its justification.

## Decision log

- 2026-06-10: Fetch ALL SIX filings from EDGAR through one clean path (incl. Apple), rather
than using a viewer-saved Apple file. Reason: provided file was unavailable; uniform path
is simpler and the CSS-residue stripping in parse.py is built defensively regardless.
- 2026-06-10: Chat LLM = Anthropic (Claude); embeddings = OpenAI. Two keys: Claude has no
embeddings API, so dense retrieval needs OpenAI text-embedding-3-small.
- 2026-06-10: EDGAR User-Agent = "Abhishek [walvekarabhishek701@gmail.com](mailto:walvekarabhishek701@gmail.com)" per SEC fair-access policy.
- 2026-06-10: BLOCKER (Phase 3): chromadb pulls native chroma-hnswlib, which has no prebuilt
wheel for Python 3.13 on Windows -> source build fails (needs MSVC C++build tools). Phase 2
needs no vector store, so deferred. RESOLVED: chromadb 1.5.9 ships prebuilt cp313 Windows
wheels (no C++ build needed); repinned 0.5.23 -> 1.5.9. Verified `import chromadb` works.
- 2026-06-10: EDGAR-fetched files are CLEAN (0 /, minimal css- noise) — unlike
the viewer-saved Apple copy the plan referenced. CSS-residue stripping kept defensively.
Files ARE Inline XBRL: ix:nonFraction tags present (NVDA ~1127) carrying value/scale/unit/
period — available for the optional headline-figure cross-check.

### Phase 2 — parse/chunk/validate (2026-06-10)

- Walk the doc as ordered leaf- +  blocks (SEC wraps each line in its own div).
- Item headings: regex `^Item N.` at position 0, NOT inside  (kills TOC links + "refer to
Item 1A" cross-refs), short block. Detected on any div (not just leaf — WMT nests its
headings) and deduped by item number so an outer wrapper + inner copy don't double-emit.
- Tables: expand colspan/rowspan into a dense grid; BLANK `$`/`%` marker cells in place (then
drop all-empty columns) so every row keeps the same width and values stay aligned to headers
— removing `$` per-row was the bug that drifted numbers off their year. Header zone = leading
rows with no *magnitude* cell; years/dates are periods (kept as headers), not values. Each
data row serialized self-contained: "section | label |  = ". Accounting
negatives (1,234) -> -1234. Layout tables (no magnitude cells) skipped. Units read from the
table text + the caption line just above (SEC puts "(In millions)" there).
- Footnotes immediately following a table are appended to that table's block as "[footnote] ...".
- Chunking: prose ~800 tokens / 100 overlap (tiktoken cl100k_base), flushed at Item boundaries
so chunks never straddle Items. Tables kept whole; tables >1000 tokens split by rows with the
header line repeated on each piece. chunk_id = "{TICKER}-{NNNN}". 2419 chunks total.
- validate.py is a REPORT (warns, never blocks): (a) Items 1/1A/7/8 present, (b) revenue term in
a numeric table, (c) CSS/JS residue, (d) irregular-row-width tables (precision heuristic:
flag when the modal row width covers <60% of rows = likely multi-level drift), (e) prints the
largest table per company + 2 seeded-random table chunks. Spot-checked headline figures by
hand: AAPL total net sales 416,161; WMT total revenues 713,163; NVDA revenue 215,938 — all
correct and bound to the right fiscal year.

### Phase 3 — retrieval, gates, threshold calibration (2026-06-10)

- Hybrid retrieval = BM25 (rank_bm25, over all chunks) + dense (OpenAI embeddings in Chroma,
cosine) fused with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF_K=60). Company metadata filter on the dense
side via Chroma `where`, on the sparse side by post-filtering. top-k 6 single / 4 per sub-query.
- Refusal gate 1 (out-of-corpus) sits on the NORMALIZED dense cosine similarity of the top chunk,
NOT the RRF score (RRF is rank-based, no absolute meaning).
- Threshold provisionally calibrated to 0.50 from the four Phase-3 checkpoint probes:
  NVIDIA revenue 0.697 | R&D sub-queries 0.61-0.71 | Coca-Cola attrition 0.518 (in-corpus,
  undisclosed) | Tesla revenue 0.487 (out-of-corpus).
0.50 sits between Tesla (out) and KO-attrition (in), so Tesla refuses via the THRESHOLD gate
and KO-attrition passes the threshold then refuses via the SYNTHESIS/gaps gate — the two-gate
design. Margin is thin (~0.015 each side) — Known Weakness #5; Phase 6 refines with the user's
eval probes (per-query-type thresholds are the next-week fix).
- anthropic SDK upgraded 0.42.0 -> 0.109.1: 0.42 predates `output_config` (structured JSON output
used for decomposition). Verified the four checkpoint questions behave per spec after upgrade.

### Phase 3/2 fix — table caption in chunk text (2026-06-10, found via manual test)

- Bug: "net sales by region for Apple" returned a false "not found" — the segment-table chunk
was parsed correctly but unretrievable: its searchable text carried only the generic Item
heading (no "segment"/"region"), so BM25+dense ranked product-table/MD&A prose above it and
it fell outside top-k. System did NOT hallucinate (refused on bad context) — a retrieval miss.
- Fix: parse.py now prepends each table's caption (the prose line just above it, e.g. "The
following table shows net sales by reportable segment...") to the table chunk's header, making
tables retrievable by description. Re-ingested (2419 -> 2427 chunks). Verified the exact query
now returns Americas 178,353 / Europe 111,032 / Greater China 64,377 / Japan 28,703 / Rest of
Asia Pacific 33,696 / Total 416,161, matching the filing. Four checkpoint questions: no regression.
- Side effect: re-embedding shifted KO-attrition probe 0.518 -> 0.503 (still > 0.50). Threshold
margin is now razor-thin — reinforces Known Weakness #5; Phase 6 calibration with more probes.

### Eval-driven failures and fixes (2026-06-10) — what broke, then how it was fixed

The 9-question eval caught two real correctness failures (both in decomposed comparisons):

WHAT BROKE

- Q3 "which company had the highest total revenue": concluded **JPMorgan ($185,581M)** — WRONG
(Walmart ~$713B is highest). Under decomposition the consolidated income-statement chunks for
Apple/Walmart/Coca-Cola/JPM were not retrieved (top-k=4), so the model maxed over the few it had.
- Q5 "compare Walmart vs Coca-Cola revenue": returned Walmart **$485,599M** — WRONG; that is the
Walmart **U.S. segment** total (chunk WMT-0182), not the **consolidated** $713,163M (WMT-0069/0099).
Right terminology ("Total revenues"), wrong scope — Known Weakness #3.
- Note: the system did NOT hallucinate. Q3 honestly hedged ("among companies with available
figures"); Q5 pulled a real-but-wrong-scope line. The defect was retrieval, not grounding.

FIX 1 — top_k_sub 4->8 + synthesis "prefer consolidated, label segment as segment-level".
  Partial: Q3 now retrieves Apple's $416,161M, but the consolidated income-statement chunk still
  ranks ~17-30 (verified: WMT-0069 only appears at k=30), so prose still outranks the buried table.

FIX 2 — Phase 5 cross-encoder reranker (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) over the top-30 fused candidates,
  toggleable via config.USE_RERANKER.

- Q5: FIXED. Reranker pulls WMT-0099 (consolidated $713,163M) into context; answer now reports
$713,163M with the correct period. No regressions on the other 8 (refusals + lookups intact).
- Q3: STILL WRONG figure. The cross-encoder is phrasing-sensitive — for Q5's wording it surfaced
the consolidated chunk, for Q3's wording it surfaced the segment chunk (WMT-0182, $485,599M)
again. Both chunks literally say "Total revenues", so neither retrieval nor reranking reliably
distinguishes the U.S.-segment total from the company total.

FIX 3 — Scope label at parse time (parse.py `_infer_scope`): prepend "Consolidated" / "Segment-level"
to every table row, inferred from the table caption/section ("consolidated"/"combined" vs
"segment"/"geographic"/"reportable"). Rows now read `Consolidated | Total revenues ... = 713,163`
vs `Segment-level | Total revenues ... = 485,599`, putting the scope in the text where retrieval,
rerank, and synthesis can all see it. Re-ingested (2440 chunks).

- Q5: still CORRECT, and now robust — the consolidated figure wins, the segment figure is clearly
labeled segment-level so it can't masquerade as the company total. Concept-mislabel fixed.
- Q3: STILL WRONG ("NVIDIA highest $215,938M"), but the cause has MOVED. The consolidated chunk
WMT-0101 now retrieves at rank ~8 in Walmart's sub-query (was ~17-30), but in the six-company
fan-out the global 24-chunk context cap (MAX_CONTEXT_CHUNKS, sorted by fused score) trims that
low-ranked chunk before synthesis sees it. So Q3 is now a context-BUDGET / recall problem, not a
concept error.

HONEST RESIDUAL: Q3 multi-company comparison still misses Walmart's (and Apple's) consolidated total.
Root cause is now the global context cap trimming a company's best table chunk when it ranks low
within its own sub-query. Next fix (cheap, principled, NOT yet applied — needs API credits to
re-verify): allocate the 24-chunk budget PER sub-query (round-robin across companies) instead of a
single global fused-score sort, so every company contributes its top chunks to a comparison. Deeper
fixes for numeric fidelity remain as before: XBRL/companyfacts cross-check (Known Weakness #1/#3),
table-aware chunking, concept-level checks. Reranker left ON (net positive, no regressions) but it
pulls a heavy torch dependency and is fully toggleable.

### Expanded eval — 20 questions (2026-06-13)
Grew the hand-written set from 9 to 20 (brief asks 10-20), adding year-over-year, segment-lookup,
computed-metric, semantic/Item-1A, alias, router-clarify, router-edge, multi-statement, and two
more refusal probes. New findings (honest; no code changed — write-up/eval pass only):
- WINS: scope label validated both directions — Sam's Club query correctly returns the SEGMENT
  figure ($93,015M, labeled segment-level) without the "prefer consolidated" rule overriding it;
  Q8 now labels Walmart's $485,599M as segment-level instead of mis-claiming consolidated. All
  refusal probes safe (Amazon, Apple-engagement, CAT-NPS — no fabrication); clarify + alias routing correct.
- NEW ROUTER BUG (Weakness #4, concrete): "most recent" contains "most", which trips SUPERLATIVE_RE,
  so "What was Amazon's net income for its most recent fiscal year?" routes to DECOMPOSE (all six)
  instead of OOS. Outcome was still safe (refused, gaps=all six), but the mechanism is wrong. Cheap
  fix: don't let "most" match inside "most recent", or evaluate the out-of-corpus-entity branch
  before the superlative branch in router.route().
- RECALL UNDER DECOMPOSITION persists (same family as the original Q3): "lowest total revenue"
  missed Coca-Cola's revenue line; "highest operating income" missed Apple's. Real fix is XBRL for
  numbers + better Item-1A semantic recall — unchanged from the next-week list.

### Phase 6 — eval harness (2026-06-10)

- eval/run_eval.py runs each question in eval/questions.yaml through the pipeline and writes
eval/results.md: a table (route, refused, refusal reason, top_sim, citations, gaps) with BLANK
grade columns (correct / grounded / refusal-correct) plus a full-answers section. Per G4 it does
NOT auto-grade and does NOT author questions; questions.yaml ships as a template for the user.
- top_sim is recorded per question so refusal probes feed threshold calibration (Known Weakness #5).
- Smoke-tested on one answerable + one refusal question (both row types render correctly).

### Phase 4 — frontend (2026-06-10)

- Single static page (static/index.html), vanilla JS, no build step. FastAPI serves it at `/`
and streams answers from `GET /api/stream?q=` via SSE (EventSource). Two event types: `token`
(incremental answer text) and `done` (citations + gaps). Citations render as expandable
  passages labeled company + section. Refusals stream as a single token + done.
- Verified at the protocol level: page serves, NVIDIA streams + cites NVDA-0179 (contains
"Total revenue = 215,938"), Tesla refuses via threshold.

All exact form "10-K" (no 10-K/A amendments). Note the differing fiscal year ends (Apple
Sep, NVDA/WMT Jan, others Dec) — this matters for cross-company comparisons (Phase 6 eval).

## Key design tradeoffs (the "why", summarized)

- **Pipeline, not agent.** A closed six-doc corpus does not need an agent. A deterministic pipeline
(router → [decompose] → retrieve → gate → synthesize) is fully debuggable and reproducible; an
agent would add nondeterminism and debugging surface for no benefit here. Cost: no autonomous
recovery from a bad retrieval — but that is exactly what the eval + manual grading expose.
- **Regex/alias router, not an LLM router.** Chosen for full explainability and determinism (G5):
the same question always routes the same way and I can explain every branch in a walkthrough.
Cost: brittle on unlisted aliases and unusual phrasing (Known Weakness #4). A temp-0 LLM router
is the first next-week item.
- **Two-gate refusal, not one.** (1) Out-of-corpus is caught by a threshold on the normalized dense
similarity of the top chunk (NOT the RRF score, which is rank-based and has no absolute meaning).
(2) In-corpus-but-undisclosed is caught by the synthesis prompt (context-only) + a per-company
`gaps` list — retrieval returns good-scoring company chunks that lack the figure, so the threshold
cannot catch it. Verified: Tesla/Microsoft refuse via gate 1; Coca-Cola attrition / JPMorgan NPS
refuse via gate 2.
- **Embeddings on OpenAI, chat on Anthropic.** Anthropic has no embeddings API; dense retrieval
needs `text-embedding-3-small`. Chat is Sonnet 4.6 (temp-0 capable; Opus 4.8 removed `temperature`).
- **Chunking:** ~800-token prose windows flushed at Item boundaries; tables kept whole and serialized
row-wise so each value carries its compound column header (number can't drift from its year).

## Known weaknesses (state these plainly; claim only what was built and run)

1. **Numeric fidelity inside complex tables is the top weakness.** Multi-level headers, per-column
  units, and accounting negatives are handled, but verified by sampling + an alignment check, not
   exhaustively. A misaligned or unusually structured table can still yield a confidently wrong
   number. Fix: XBRL cross-check of headline figures against the `<ix:nonFraction>` facts in the
   same files (the files are Inline XBRL; tags are present, e.g. ~1127 in NVDA).
2. **Footnote linkage is local, not global.** Footnotes immediately following a table ride along in
  its chunk and in-table markers are preserved as `[fn1]`, but there is no reference graph linking
   an arbitrary marker to its note text. A figure whose qualifier lives elsewhere can be returned
   unqualified. Fix: build the marker→note graph and attach the resolved note to the citing chunk.
3. **Grounds on terminology, does not understand accounting.** Demonstrated live by eval Q3/Q5: the
  system reported Walmart's **U.S.-segment** "Total revenues" ($485,599M) as the **consolidated**
   total ($713,163M) — right term, wrong scope/concept. Per-figure citations make every answer
   auditable by a human, but the system will not self-catch this. Fix: label segment-table rows with
   the segment name at parse time; XBRL cross-check; concept-level checks / tighter retrieval on
   near-miss line items.
4. **Router brittleness.** Regex routing mis-handles unlisted aliases and unusual phrasing — a
  deliberate trade for explainability and determinism. Fix: a temp-0 LLM router.
5. **Refusal threshold calibrated on a handful of probes.** A single global value on a normalized-
  dense-similarity scale is not optimal across query types, and the margin is thin (Tesla 0.48 /
   Microsoft 0.454 out vs Coca-Cola-attrition 0.503 / JPMorgan-NPS 0.548 in — ~0.003 in one case).
   Fix: per-query-type thresholds, or a cross-encoder relevance score for the gate.

One-line summary for the room: **strong on retrieval and honesty, weaker on numeric fidelity inside
complex tables (esp. segment-vs-consolidated), and here is exactly how I would close that gap.**

## Next week (in priority order)

1. **Temp-0 LLM router** for alias/phrasing robustness (closes Weakness #4).
2. **XBRL / companyfacts cross-check** of headline figures against the tagged consolidated facts
  (closes much of #1 and #3 — the segment-vs-consolidated error).
3. **Label segment-table rows with the segment name** at parse time so segment totals can't
  masquerade as company totals (#3).
4. **Contextual / table-aware chunking** and a marker→footnote reference graph (#1, #2).
5. **Per-query-type threshold calibration**, or move the gate onto the cross-encoder score (#5).
6. **Harden the reranker** (it's phrasing-sensitive today) or try a finance-tuned cross-encoder.
